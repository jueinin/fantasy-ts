# Fantasy-ts
this is a simple partial implements of the fantasy-land specification, based on 
this gitbook [mostly-adequate-guide](https://mostly-adequate.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide)

## Motivation
Recently, i start to learn javascript functional programming. after finishing the curry and compose study, i come across functors, such as Maybe,
Either,and IO...etc.However i end up finding that, many functors were written in pure javascript include [fantasy-land](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land) 
and [ramda-fantasy](https://github.com/ramda/ramda-fantasy) ,meanwhile, they don't provide any typescript type declaration file.Therefore, the experiences is not good 
when they are used in typescript. so that i attempt to rewrite it in ts to get a better experience! I am a new hand in FP and write package, it's little hard for me to work.

## Installation
`yarn add fantasy-ts`   or  
`npm install fantasy-ts`
